# Xenko_Asteroids
Asteroids created in Xenko Beta 1.8.3
Xenko that uses C# and the open source XNA source that includes SharpDX, is a project in its infincy. More information to come.
My thing is to make Asteroids in whatever new engine I'm checking out, as a way of checking it out.
You will find the binary filese inside the rar file, download and unzip into a folder to play. If you have WinRAR you can play it without unziping it.
To play the game press 'N' to start. Left and Right arrow keys rotate ship. Up arrow is thrust. Left Ctrl or Space to fire. Down arrow is hyperspace.
I hope you enjoy the game!
