# Xenko_Asteroids
Asteroids project updated to Xenko 3 August 13th 2018.
Xenko that uses C# and is MIT open source that uses Monogame.
My thing is to make Asteroids in whatever new engine I'm checking out, as a way of checking it out.
You will find the binary filese inside the zip file, download and unzip into a folder to play. If you have WinRAR you can play it without unziping it.
To play the game press 'N', 'S' or 'Enter' to start. Left and Right arrow keys rotate ship. Up arrow is thrust. Left Ctrl or Space to fire. Down arrow is hyperspace. Use the 'P' to pause the game.
For high score initial entery, rotate to change letter, hyperspace to goto next.
High score list now saved to file, game must be in user writable folder such as your desktop or My Documents or it will crash. I will move the save game file to "My Documents" when I figure out how.
I hope you enjoy the game!
